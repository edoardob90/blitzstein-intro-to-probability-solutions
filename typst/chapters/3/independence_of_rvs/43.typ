+ Let $X equiv a$ (mod $b$) and $Y equiv X + 1$ (mod $b$). Then, $\lim_{b
\to infinity} P(X < Y) = 1$.

For finite random variables $X$ and $Y$, the case of $P(X < Y) gt.eq 1$ is not 
possible, since then $Y$ can never achieve the smallest value of $X$,
contradicting the assumption that $X$ and $Y$ have the same distribution.

+ If $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables with the same
distribution, then $P(X < Y) lt.eq (1)/(2)$
