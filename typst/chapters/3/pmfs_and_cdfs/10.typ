+ Let $P(n) = (k)/(n)$ for $n in bb(N)$. By principles of
probability, $\sum_{n in bb(N)}P(n)$ must equal $1$.

$\sum_{n in bb(N)}P(n) = k\sum_{n in bb(N)}(1)/(n).$ The sum
on the right side of the equality is a divergent, harmonic series. Hence. the
aforementioned principle of probably is violated. Contradiction.

+ $\sum_{n in bb(N)}(1)/(n^{2)} = \frac{\pi^{2}}{6}$. Thus,
letting $k$ equal $(6)/(\pi^{2)}$, the principle of probability is
satisfied.
