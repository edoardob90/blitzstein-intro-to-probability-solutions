+ Since the trials are independent, the probability that the first $k-1$
trials fail is $((1)/(2))^{k-1}$, and the probability that the 
$k$-th trial is successful is $(1)/(2)$. Thus, for $k gt.eq 1$,

$P(X=k) = ((1)/(2))^{k-1}*(1)/(2).$

+ This problem reduces to part $a$ once a trial is performed. Whatever it's
outcome, we label it failure and proceed to perform more trials until the
opposite outcome is observed. Thus, for $k gt.eq 2$,

$P(X=k) = ((1)/(2))^{k-2} * (1)/(2).$
