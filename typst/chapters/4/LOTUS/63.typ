$\text{E}(2^{X}) = sum_(k=0)^(infinity)2^{k}(1-p)^{k}p = psum_(k=0)^(infinity)
(2-2p)^{k} = (p)/(2p-1)$ when $2-2p < 1 arrow.r.double p > (1)/(2)$.

$\text{E}(2^{-X}) = sum_(k=0)^(infinity)2^{-k}(1-p)^{k}p = p\sum_{k=0}^
{infinity}((1-p)/(2))^{k} = (p)/(\frac{1+p){2}} = (2p)/(1+p)$ when $
(1-p)/(2) < 1$ which is always true.
