Let $I_{j}$ be the indicator variable for the $j$-toss landing on an outcome
different from the previous toss for $2 lt.eq j lt.eq n$. Then, the total number
of such tosses is $X = sum_(j=2)^(n)I_{j}$. The total number of runs
is $Y = X + 1$. Since $\text{E}(X) = sum_(j=2)^(n)P(I_
{j}=1) = sum_(j=2)^(n)(1)/(2) = (n-1)/(2)$, $\text{E}(Y) = \frac{n-1}
{2} + 1 = (n+1)/(2)$.
