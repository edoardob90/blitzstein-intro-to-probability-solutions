Random variable $f(X)$ takes values that are the probabilities of a random value
taken by $X$. Since $X \sim \text{Geom}(p)$, $f(X) in \{ (1-p)^{k}p | k in
bb(Z)_{gt.eq 0} \}$, and each value $(1-p)^{k}p$ of $f(X)$ occurs with
probability $(1-p)^{k}p$. Thus,

$\text{E}(X) = sum_(k=0)^(infinity)((1-p)^{k}p)^{2} = -(p)/(p-2)$ for $|p -
1|^{2} < 1$.
