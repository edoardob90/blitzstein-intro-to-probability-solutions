+ Let $Z$ represent the number of flips until both Nick and Penny flip
Heads. Then is $Z \sim \text{FS}(p_{1}p_{2})$, since Nick's and
Penny's flips are independent. $\text{E}(Z) = (1)/(p_{1)p_{2}}$

+ The logic is analogous to part $a$, but success probability is $p_{1} + p_
{2} - p_{1}p_{2}$.

+ $P(X_{1} = X_{2}) = sum_(k=1)^(infinity)(((1-p)^{2})^{k-1}p^{2}) = 
(p)/(2-p)$

+ By symmetry, $P(X_{1} < X_{2}) = (1-(\frac{p)/(2-p))}{2} = \frac{1-p}
{2-p}$
