+ Let $I_{j}$ be the indicator variable that $j$ person in Bob's sample is
also sampled by Alice. Then, $P(I_{j}=1) = (1)/(10)$. Then, the expected
number of people in Bob's and Alice's samples is $2$.

+ $|A union B| = 100 + 20 - |A sect B| arrow.r.double \text{E}(|A union B|) =
100 + 20 - \text{E}(|A sect B|) = 100 + 20 - 2 = 118$.

+ Let $I_{j}$ be the indicator random variable for couple $j$ being in Bob's
sample. Then $P(I_{j}=1) = (binom(998, 18))/(binom(1000, 20))$. Thus, the
expected number of couples in Bob's sample is $\text{E}(X) = 500(
binom(998, 18))/(binom(1000, 20)) approx 0.2$.
