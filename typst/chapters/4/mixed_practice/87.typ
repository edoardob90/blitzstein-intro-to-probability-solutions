+ Let $I_{j}$ be the indicator random variable for $j$ person in the sample
being a democrat. Let $X$ be the total number of democrats in the sample. Then,
$\text{E}(X) = sum_(j=1)^(c)I_{j} = c(d)/(100)$

+ Let $I_{j}$ be the indicator random variable for state $j$ being
represented by at least one person in the sample. Then $P(I_{j} = 1) = 
1 - (binom(98, c))/(binom(100, c))$. Then, the expected number of states
represented in the sample is $\text{E}(X) = 50(1 - (binom(98, c))/(
binom(100, c)))$.

+ Similarly to part $b$, $\text{E}(X) = 50(binom(98, c-2))/(\binom{100)
{c}}$.

+ $P(X = k) = (binom(50, k)binom(50, 20-k))/(binom(100, 20))$ for $0
lt.eq k lt.eq 20$.

Letting $I_{j}$ be the indicator variable for person $j$ in the sample being a
junior senator of a state, $\text{E}(X) = 20(50)/(100) = 10$.

+ Similar to part $b$, $\text{E}(X) = 50(binom(98, 18))/(\binom{100)
{20}}$.
