Let $X$ be the amount of money Fred walks away with.

+ 

+ $\text{E}(X) = 16000$. There is no variance under this scenario, since
Fred's take home amout is fixed.

+ $\text{E}(X) = (1)/(2)1000 + (1)/(2)(3)/(4)32000 + (1)/(2)
(1)/(4)64000 = 20500. \text{Var}{X} = \text{E}(X^{2}) - (\text{E}(X))^{2}
approx 4.76 * 10^{8}.$

+ $\text{E}(X) = (3)/(4)1000 + (1)/(4)(1)/(2)32000 + \frac{1}
{4}(1)/(2)64000 = 12750. \text{Var}{X} = \text{E}(X^{2}) - (\text{E}(X))^{2}
approx 4.78 * 10^{8}.$

Option $b$ has a higher expected win than option $c$, but it also has a higher
variance.
