Let k be the median, therefore $P(X \ge k) \ge (1)/(2)$ and $P(X \le k) \ge (1)/(2)$, therefore $P(X \le k) \le (1)/(2)$. 
 
Hence,
$
    P(X \le k) = (1)/(2) 

    F(k) =  (1)/(2) 

    k = (\ln(2))/(\lambda)
$
where F is the CDF of X. 

Let c be the mode, $f$ be the PDF of X, since $f(x)$ is decreasing for all $x \ge 0$ ($f'(x) = -\lambda^{2}e^{-\lambda x}$) or is 0 otherwise, $f(x)$ has its maxima when $x=0$, hence, the mode is 0.
