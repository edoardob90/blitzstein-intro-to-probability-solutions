Let $G_{i}$ be the event that the $i$-th child is a girl. Let $C_{i}$ be the
event that the $i$-th child has property $C$.

$P(G_{1} sect G_{2}|(G_{1} sect C_{1} )union (G_{2} sect C_{2})) = \frac{0.25
(2p - p^{2})}{0.5p+ 0.5p - 0.25p^{2}} = (0.5(2-p))/(2-0.5p) = 
(2-p)/(4-p).$

This result confirms the idea that the more rare characteristic $C$ is, the
closer we get to specifying which child we mean when we say that at least one of
the children has $C$.
