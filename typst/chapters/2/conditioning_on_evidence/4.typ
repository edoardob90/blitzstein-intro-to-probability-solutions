+ \begin{flalign}
P(K|R)  = (P(K)P(R|K))/(P(R)) \nonumber 

 = (P(K)P(R|K))/(P(K)P(R|K) + P(K^{c))P(R|K^{c})} \nonumber 

 = (p)/(p + (1-p)\frac{1){n}} \nonumber
\end{flalign}

+ Since $p + (1-p)(1)/(n) lt.eq 1$, $P(K|R) gt.eq p$ with strict 
equality only when $p = 1$. This result makes sense, since if Fred gets 
the answer right, it is more likely that he knew the answer.
