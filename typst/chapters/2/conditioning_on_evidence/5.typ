By symmetry, all 50 of the remaining cards are equally likely. Thus, the 
probability that the third card is an ace is $(3)/(50)$.

We can reach the same answer using the definition of conditional probability. 
Let $A$ be the event that the first card is the Ace of Spades, $B$ be the event 
that the second card is the $8$ of Clubs and $C$ be the event that the third 
card is an ace. Then, 
$P(C|A,B) = (P(C,A,B))/(P(A,B)) = (\frac{3*49!)/(52!)}{(50!)/(52!)} 
= (3)/(50)$
