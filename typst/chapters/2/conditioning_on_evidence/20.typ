+ 

+ Since the second card is equally likely to be any of the remaining $3$ cards,
the probability that both cards are queens is $(1)/(3)$.

+ Our sample space now consists of all order pairs of the two queens and 
the two jacks, where at least one card is a queen. Since all the outcomes are
equally likely,
the answer is $(2)/(10) = (1)/(5)$.

+ Now, the sample space consists of all order pairs of the two queens and 
the two jacks, where one of the cards is the Queen of Hearts. Thus, the answer
is $(2)/(6) = (1)/(3)$.
