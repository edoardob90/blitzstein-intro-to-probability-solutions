Let $D$ be the event that the mother has the disease. Let $C_{i}$ be the event
that the $i$-th child has the disease.

+ The two events are not independent. If the elder child has the disease,
the mother has the disease, which means the younger child has probability $
(1)/(2)$ of having the disease. Unconditionally, the younger child has
probability $(1)/(6)$ of having the disease.

P(D|C_{1}^{c} sect C_{2}^{c}) = \frac{P(D)P(C_{1}^{c} sect C_{2}^{c} | D)}{P

= (\frac{1)/(3)*(1)/(4)}{(1)/(3)*(1)/(4) + (2)/(3)}
