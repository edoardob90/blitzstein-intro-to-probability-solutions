+ 

+ $y = dp + (1-d)(1-p)$

+ The worst choice for $p$ is $(1)/(2)$, because then the fraction of
"yes" responses is $(1)/(2)$ irrespective of the fraction of drug users. In
other words, the number of "yes" responses tells us nothing.

+ We can extend the result from part $a$. 

A drug user says "yes" either if they get a "Have you used drugs" slip, or
if they get a "I was born in winter" slip and they are, in fact, born in winter.

A person who has not used drugs says "yes" only in the case that
they get a "I was born in winter" slip and they were, in fact,
born in winter.

$y = d(p + (1)/(4)(1-p)) + (1-d)(1-p)(1)/(4)$

Thus,

$d = (4y + p - 1)/(2p)$
