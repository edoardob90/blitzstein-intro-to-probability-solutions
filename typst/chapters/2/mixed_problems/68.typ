+ $OR = (P(D|C))/(P(D^{c)|C)} * \frac{P(D^{c}|C^{c})}{P
(D|C^{c})}$

Since the disease is rare among both exposed and not exposed groups, $P(D^{c}|C)
approx 1$ and $P(D^{c}|C^{c}) approx 1$. Thus,

$OR approx (P(D|C))/(P(D|C^{c))} = RR$

+ $\frac{P(C,D)P(C^{c}, D^{c})}{P(C, D^{c}){P(C^{c}, D)}} = \frac{P(C)P(D|C)P
(C^{c})P(D|C^{c})}{P(C)P(D^{c}|C)P(C^{c})P(D|C^{c})} = OR$

+ Since $P(C, D)$ also equals $P(D)P(C|D)$, reversing the roles of $C$ and
$D$ in part $b$ gives the result.
