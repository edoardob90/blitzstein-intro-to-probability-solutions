The problem is equivalent to betting $1$ increments and having $A$ start with
$ki$ dollars, while $B$ starts with $k(N-i)$ dollars.

Thus, $p < (1)/(2)$,

$p_{i} = (1 - \left(\frac{q)/(p)\right)^{ki}}{1 - \left((q)/(p)\right)^
{kN}}.$

Note that,

$\lim_{k \to infinity} (1 - \left(\frac{q)/(p)\right)^{ki}}{1 - \left(
(q)/(p)\right)^{kN}} = \lim_{k \to infinity} (-ki\left(\frac{q)/(p)\right)
^{ki-1}}{-kN\left((q)/(p)\right)^{kN-1}} = (i)/(N)\lim_{k \to infinity} 
(1)/(\left(\frac{q){p}\right)^{k(N-i)}} = 0.$

This result makes sense, since $p < (1)/(2)$ implies that $A$ should lose
a game with high degree of certainty over the long run.
