+ $binom(2n-1, n-1)$

+ The least likely bootstrap sample is one where $a_{1} = a_{2} = dot.c = a_{n}$. 
Such a sample occurs with probability $(1)/(n^{n)}$. The most likely 
bootstrap sample is one where all the terms are different. Such a sample 
occurs with probability $(n!)/(n^{n)}$. Thus, the ratio of the probabilities 
is $n!$
