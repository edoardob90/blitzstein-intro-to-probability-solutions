+ Each of the $n$ inputs has $m$ choices for an output, resulting in 
$m^{n}$ possible functions.

+ If $n gt.eq m$, at least two inputs will be mapped to the same output, 
so no one-to-one function is possible. 
  
  If $n < m$, the first input has $m$ choices, the second input has $m - 1$ 
  choices, and so on. The total number of one-to-one functions then is 
  $m(m-1)(m-2)...(m-n+1) = (m!)/((m-n)!) $
