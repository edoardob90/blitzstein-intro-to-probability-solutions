+ Inequality can be demonstrated using the first property of probabilities,
$P(A union B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A sect B)$ and the first axiom of probabilities,
$P(S) = 1.$

$P(A) + P(B) - P(A sect B) lt.eq 1 arrow.r.double P(A) + P(B) - 1 lt.eq P(A sect B)$. 

Strict equality holds if and only if $A union B = S$ where $S$ is the sample space.

+ Since $A sect B subset.eq A union B$, $P(A sect B) lt.eq P(A union B)$ by
 the second property of probabilites.

Strict equality holds if and only if $A = B.$

+ Inequality follows directly from the first property of probabilities
 with strict equality if and only if $P(A sect B) = 0.$
