a.  F(x) is continuous at its given endpoints: $F(1) = (2)/(\pi)arcsin(1) = (2)/(\pi)(\pi)/(2) = 1$ and $F(0) = 0$, and F(x) is differentiable between 0 and 1:

b. $F'(x) = f(x) = (2)/(\pi)(d)/(dx)(arcsin(sqrt(x))) = (2)/(\pi)((1)/(sqrt(1-x)))((1)/(sqrt(x)))$

This is a valid PDF despite the discontinuities at 0 and 1 as the integral of $f(x)$ from 0 to 1 converges, and $f(x)$ is always positive - the same reason why $(1)/(sqrt(x))$ has a discontinuity at $x=0$ but can be integrated from 0 to any positive real number.
