      Contributed solutions to end of chapter exercises in <em>Introduction to Probability</em>,
      2nd edition by Joe Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang.
    </p>

    <p>
      The book contains many fantastic exercises that help develop intuition for thinking
      probabilistically. The authors provide solutions to some of these exercises on the book
      <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home">website</a>, but most don't have
      published solutions. This repository aims to provide solutions for self-learners.
